This poster was inspired by [Bread and Puppet](http://breadandpuppet.org/)'s [resistance](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0080/8552/products/IMG_7383.jpg?3884) [posters](http://theyesmenfixtheworld.com/guide/images/thumb/Resistance.jpg/283px-Resistance.jpg).

Everything black on this poster was printed with the letterpress: the top is wood type, the middle is a linoleum block I carved, and the bottom is 18 point Garamond. I then hand painted the color on the daffodils, on each of around twenty prints. The combination of mass production and hand painting is something I have always loved about Bread and Puppet's posters, though the posters they generally sell are photocopied rather than printed.
