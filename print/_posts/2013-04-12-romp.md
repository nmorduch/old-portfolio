I did the entirety of the print design for the 2013 Dandelion Romp, a contra dance festival held every year at Oberlin. My goal was to have a consistent look, so in all materials I used a drawing done by [Anna Droege](http://annadroege.tumblr.com/) for this event and the typeface Clarendon.

Below are the poster, alternate poster, both sides of the schedule, shirt design, and button design.
