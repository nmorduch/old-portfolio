My a capella group, [Nothing But Treble](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Nothing-But-Treble/151757761525890), chose a tea party theme for our end-of-semester concert. All I knew from the moment we picked the theme was that the poster was going to involve a big blue teacup, though the teacup I initially pictured was very different from the one shown here. I ended up modeling the cup on those found at the [Slow Train Cafe](http://www.slowtraincafe.com/), a coffee shop in Oberlin.

The design for this poster was entirely hand-drawn, then scanned and manipulated in Illustrator and Photoshop. I screen printed the poster in three runs: blue, brown, and cream.
