This poster required a lot of information, including enough of a schedule that people could come to the event without finding any more information about it. People were likely to be interested in a variety of different parts of the event, and the purple headers are designed to draw attention to each of those aspects. It was also important to make it relatively clear that the event was focused on swing dancing, rather than all kinds of jazz dance.

This poster was designed entirely in InDesign. The colors are light blue, purple, and black. I'm particularly fond of the ampersands in this design.
