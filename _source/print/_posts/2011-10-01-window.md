For the first two-color assignment in my silkscreen class, I painted the two parts of the design by hand, and directly transferred those images to the screen. I played with putting a variety of colors into each layer, making both a smooth gradient and a messier collection of colors. I made a number of rather different prints, of which this is one of my favorites.
